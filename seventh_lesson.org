* Homework
  - Using `Enum.reduce` find the largest number in a list of numbers
  - Write a recursive function to calculate the power of a number
  - Write a function to count the digits in a number
  - Write a function, to find the greatest common denominator of two numbers
  - From project Euler:
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
  - Again from project Euler:
  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
